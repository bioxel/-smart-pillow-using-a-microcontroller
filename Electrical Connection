1. Arduino Power
•	Connect the 9V rechargeable battery to the VIN pin and GND of the Arduino Mega.
•	Ensure the battery is fully charged for stable operation.
2. 4-pin Sound Sensor
•	VCC: Connect to 5V on the Arduino Mega.
•	GND: Connect to GND.
•	OUT: Connect to a digital pin, e.g., D2.
•	AO (Analog Out): Connect to an analog pin (optional), e.g., A0, for detailed sound intensity data.
3. DHT11 Sensor
•	VCC: Connect to 5V on the Arduino.
•	GND: Connect to GND.
•	DATA: Connect to a digital pin, e.g., D3.
•	Use a 10kΩ pull-up resistor between the DATA and VCC pins.
4. FSR Sensor
•	Connect one leg of the FSR to 5V.
•	Connect the other leg to a 10kΩ pull-down resistor connected to GND, and the same point to an analog pin, e.g., A1.
5. Relay Module
•	VCC: Connect to 5V on the Arduino.
•	GND: Connect to GND.
•	IN: Connect to a digital pin, e.g., D4.
•	Connect the 6V battery to the COM and NO (Normally Open) pins of the relay, and wire the air pump to the same.
6. 20x4 LCD (with I2C Adapter)
•	Connect the SDA pin to SDA on Arduino (Mega pin 20).
•	Connect the SCL pin to SCL on Arduino (Mega pin 21).
•	Connect VCC to 5V and GND to GND.
